# MovingSounds

This project aims to creating a sound moving effect using signal processing techniques. 
Add time delays to the sound and manipulate the magnitudes of left and right stereo sounds to create a moving sound effect
The results audio file will move from left to right, and from right to left
Codes were implemented using Python and MATLAB

## Python Version
* Various libraray, such as SoundFile, NumPy, pydub, are needed to be installed
* mp3 and wave file are supported, but mp3 files must be converted to wave file before processing using convert.py
* Users need to enter a number between 1 and 2, which is related to the speed of moving sounds
* Resulted file will be played in the end

## MATLAB VERSION
* Signal Processing Toolbox is needed to be installed
* mp3 and wave files are supported
* Users need to enter a number between 1 and 2, which is related to the speed of moving sounds
* Resulted file will be played in the end
